# Morf - yet another form library for Kohana PHP

This is the active development tree for the Morf form module for [Kohana](http://www.kohanaphp.com)

## Git rather than SVN?

I have chosen to host this project on Github rather than Google Code. The reason for this is simple; I like Git. Unlike SVN, Git is distributed rather than centralised. [Shadowhand](http://github.com/shadowhand) has created a very useful explanation of how to use Git with Kohana projects [here](http://github.com/kohana/kohana/tree/master/README.markdown).

## How to get Morf

If you have Git installed on your system, the easiest way to get Git is to use the command line. First navigate to your Kohana modules folder, then enter :

	git clone git://github.com/samsoir/morf.git

This is the equivalent to svn checkout url.

To update your local copy when changes occur, in your local Kohana modules folder enter :

	git pull morf

Alternatively you can download a zip or tar file directly from Github, just select the download button and choose your desired format. The downside of this is that you will manually have to update your local copy.

## How to use Morf

Full documentation will be provided soon.
